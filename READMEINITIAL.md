## Social Engineering Attacks



Why are Social Engineering attacks effective?


6 Key Principles of Social Engineering
* _Authority_ - 
* _Intimidation_ - 
* _Consensus/Social proof_ - 
* _Scarcity_ - 
* _Familiarity/Liking_ - 
* _Urgency_ - 

# Main 4 Social Engineering attack vectors

# OSI Model
7 layers of the OSI model with Layer 1 being the lowest layer in the model.

7. _Application Layer_ - Protocol Data Unit (PDU) = Data
    Function: High-level protocols e.g. Resource sharing or remote file access.

6. _Presentation Layer_ - Protocol Data Unit (PDU) = Data
    Function: Translation of data between a networking service and an application e.g. Character encoding, data compression and encryption/decryption.

5. _Session Layer_ - Protocol Data Unit (PDU) = Data
    Function: Managing communication sessions e.g. Continuous exchange of information in the form of multiple back and forth transmissions between two nodes.

4. _Transport Layer_ - Protocol Data Unit (PDU) = Segment, Datagram
    Function: Reliable transmission of data segments between pooints on a network e.g. Segmentation, acknowledgement and multiplexing

3. _Network Layer_ - Protocol Data Unit (PDU) = Packet
    Function: Structuring and managing a multi-node network e.g. addressing, routing and traffic control.

2. _Data Link Layer_ - Protocol Data Unit (PDU) = Frame
    Function: Transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer e.g. ...

1. _Physical Layer_ - Protocol Data Unit (PDU) = Bit, Symbol
    Function: Transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium e.g. ...
